# ontogenetic_shift_JVS

This repository includes the code to create figures and tables shown in the paper: "Water availability mediates functional shifts across ontogenetic stages in a regenerating seasonally dry tropical forest". To reproduce it, you can either download or clone this repository.

- Adults in old-growth forests were sampled by Rito et al. (2017) and functional traits by Sfair et al. (2018); Adults and functional traits in regenerating forests were collected by Barros et al. (in prep.); Seed rain and bank were sampled by de Paula et al. (in prep.).
